// Package functest contains some helper functions to assist in writing
// comprehensive tests for cty functions.
//
// These utilities might also be helpful for testing other function-like
// constructs in calling applications, if tests of those constructs take the
// form of consuming one or more cty values and returning a cty value as a
// result.
